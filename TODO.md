# TODO

 * Move commands over to AikarCommand and AikarCommandManager
 
 * Move config parsing over to an extension of CoreConfigManager
 
 * Add a default config.yml to the resources

 * Update the config section "blocked" to allow more configurability, such as denying item stacks and custom items,
   rather than just a list of lore.
 
 * Transition over to safe trade inventory APIs
 
 * Discuss dropping legacy support
